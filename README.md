# Panlexicon (Jekyll)

Panlexicon is a unique thesaurus that provides a quicker and more intuitive process for finding the words you want.

This version is built using Jekyll, a static site generator. This is a replacement of the original Panlexicon site which was built first in Drupal, then Ruby on Rails.
